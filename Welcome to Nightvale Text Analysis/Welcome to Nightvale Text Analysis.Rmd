  As practice in scraping multiple webpages, and in analyzing multiple related 
texts, I decided to collect and analyze all transcripts for the "Welcome to
Nightvale" podcast. The transcripts are available through their main site:
[link](nightvalepresents.com).

```{r packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(gridExtra)
library(cowplot)
```

  As always, we load in our libraries. We'll be using rvest for scraping, and
the others for analysis and visualization.

```{r facet_bar, echo=FALSE}
colors <- c("darkgreen", "brown", "blue4", "darkmagenta", "darkorange2", "gray",
            "lawngreen", "lightseagreen", "royalblue2", "plum", "yellow2")

facet_bar <- function(df, y, x, by, nrow = 2, ncol = 2, scales = "free") {
  mapping <- aes(y = reorder_within({{ y }}, {{ x }}, {{ by }}), 
                 x = {{ x }}, 
                 fill = factor({{ by }}),
                 group = {{by}})
  
  facet <- facet_wrap(vars({{ by }}), 
                      nrow = nrow, 
                      ncol = ncol,
                      scales = scales) 
  
  ggplot(df, mapping = mapping) + 
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) + 
    scale_y_reordered() + 
    facet + 
    scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +
    ylab("")
} 
```

### Scraping Data

```{r pages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
counter = 2012
new_urls = "http://www.nightvalepresents.com/welcome-to-night-vale-transcripts?year=%s"
i = 1
w = 1
all_frames <- list()

while(counter < 2023){
  home <- read_html(sprintf(new_urls, counter))
  links <- home %>%
    html_nodes(".entry-title") %>%
    html_nodes("a") %>%
    html_attr("href") %>%
    xml2::url_absolute("https://www.nightvalepresents.com/welcome-to-night-vale-transcripts")
  links <- rev(links)
  for(x in 1:length(links)){
    script <- read_html(links[x]) %>%
      html_nodes("p+ p") %>%
      html_text()
    df <- data.frame(Episode = i,
                     Relative_Episode = w,
                      Year = counter,
                      Transcript = seq(1:length(script)))
    df$Transcript <- script
    all_frames[[i]] <- df
    i = i+1
    w = w + 1
  }
  counter = counter + 1
  w = 1
}

nightvale <- bind_rows(all_frames)
```


  This section loads in the base url for the podcast transcripts. However, this
page itself doesn't have the transcripts itself. Instead it contains links  to
individual pages, with one transcript per page. We use a while loop to go
through the page for a given year and save the links into a list. It then uses a
for loop to pass through that list, taking the year produced, the base episode 
number, the relative episode (starting from 1 each new year), and the transcript
for the episode. It's important to note that the transcripts are only available 
in paragraphs, so each row is a new paragraph. Once a dataframe is created, it's 
added to a list. After exiting the loop, we can bind all the dataframes together
into one large one to work on.


### Tokens 

```{r tokenization, fig.width=6.5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tidy_vale<- nightvale %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, Transcript) %>%
  mutate(word = gsub("â€™", "", word)) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)

tidy_vale <- subset(tidy_vale, !grepl("[^a-zA-Z]", word))

tidy_vale %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > 500) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = word)) + geom_col()

annual_bigrams <- nightvale %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  unnest_tokens(bigrams, Transcript, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>%
  separate(bigrams, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word,
         !word2 %in% stop_words$word,
         is.na(word1) == FALSE,
         is.na(word2) == FALSE,
         !grepl("[^a-zA-Z]", word1),
         !grepl("[^a-zA-Z]", word1)) %>%
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  unite(bigrams, word1, word2, sep = " ")
```

  Throughout the entire podcast, the two most important words are "night" and
"vale". Which makes sense, as they're in the name of the show. Other key words 
in this list are "cecil" (which is the name of the narrator), "carlos" (who is a
love interest for the narrator), and "listeners" (because the podcast is done as
a radio show broadcast in the small southwestern town of Nightvale).


```{r bigrams, fig.width=6.5}
nightvale_bigrams <- nightvale %>%
  unnest_tokens(bigrams, Transcript, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>%
  separate(bigrams, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word,
         !word2 %in% stop_words$word,
         is.na(word1) == FALSE,
         is.na(word2) == FALSE,
         !grepl("[^a-zA-Z]", word1),
         !grepl("[^a-zA-Z]", word1)) %>%
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE) %>%
  unite(bigrams, word1, word2, sep = " ")

all_bg <- nightvale_bigrams %>%
  filter(n > 75) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = reorder(bigrams, n))) + geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Bigram Counts in All Episodes", x = "n", y = "Bigram")
  
```

  While our individual tokens gave us a glimpse at the more common topics, 
using bigrams helps us get a more specific idea of what the texts talk about.
"night vale" is still the most common, but that's not particularly surprising.
Of more significant note are the phrases "city council", "secret police", and 
"dog park". While the city council and Sheriff's secret police are long term 
topics of the show, the dog park is less of one. It was part of the pilot 
episode, with the first mention reading:

  > The City Council announces the opening of a new dog park at the corner of 
  Earl and Summerset, near the Ralphs. They would like to remind everyone that 
  dogs are not allowed in the dog park. People are not allowed in the dog park. 
  It is possible you will see hooded figures in the dog park. Do not approach 
  them. Do not approach the dog park. The fence is electrified and highly 
  dangerous. Try not to look at the dog park and especially do not look for any 
  period of time at the hooded figures. The dog park will not harm you.
  
  After which the narrator described it as a mysterious place where interns 
vanished, the mangled remains of prehistoric creatures could be found near, and
that may or may not emit a static-y hum that is actually a coded message from an
"unearthly voice" urging citizens to bring precious metals and toddlers to the 
dog park. 


```{r graph2012}
nightvale_2012 <- annual_bigrams %>%
  filter(Year == "2012")

graph2012 <- nightvale_2012 %>%
  head(5)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= n, y = reorder(bigrams,n))) + geom_col(fill = "darkgreen") +
  labs(title = "2012 Bigrams", y = "Bigrams")

```

  
  In order to graph the most important bigrams for each year of the podcast, we 
need to filter out each year, sort it, take the top handful (5 in this case), 
and create a saved graph. I did this for all 11 years of the show, then used
plot_grid to make the following plot.


```{r other years, echo=FALSE}
nightvale_2013 <- annual_bigrams %>%
  filter(Year == "2013")

graph2013 <- nightvale_2013 %>%
  head(5)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= n, y = reorder(bigrams,n))) + geom_col(fill = "brown") +
  labs(title = "2013 Bigrams", y = "Bigrams")

nightvale_2014 <- annual_bigrams %>%
  filter(Year == "2014")

graph2014 <- nightvale_2014 %>%
  head(5)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= n, y = reorder(bigrams,n))) + geom_col(fill = "blue4") +
  labs(title = "2014 Bigrams", y = "Bigrams")

nightvale_2015 <- annual_bigrams %>%
  filter(Year == "2015")

graph2015 <- nightvale_2015 %>%
  head(5)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= n, y = reorder(bigrams,n))) + geom_col(fill = "darkmagenta") +
  labs(title = "2015 Bigrams", y = "Bigrams")

nightvale_2016 <- annual_bigrams %>%
  filter(Year == "2016")

graph2016 <- nightvale_2016 %>%
  head(5)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= n, y = reorder(bigrams,n))) + geom_col(fill = "darkorange2") +
  labs(title = "2016 Bigrams", y = "Bigrams")

nightvale_2017 <- annual_bigrams %>%
  filter(Year == "2017")

graph2017 <- nightvale_2017 %>%
  head(5)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= n, y = reorder(bigrams,n))) + geom_col(fill = "gray") +
  labs(title = "2017 Bigrams", y = "Bigrams")

nightvale_2018 <- annual_bigrams %>%
  filter(Year == "2018")

graph2018 <- nightvale_2018 %>%
  head(5)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= n, y = reorder(bigrams,n))) + geom_col(fill = "lawngreen") +
  labs(title = "2018 Bigrams", y = "Bigrams")

nightvale_2019 <- annual_bigrams %>%
  filter(Year == "2019")

graph2019 <- nightvale_2019 %>%
  head(5)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= n, y = reorder(bigrams,n))) + geom_col(fill = "lightseagreen") +
  labs(title = "2019 Bigrams", y = "Bigrams")

nightvale_2020 <- annual_bigrams %>%
  filter(Year == "2020")

graph2020 <- nightvale_2020 %>%
  head(5)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= n, y = reorder(bigrams,n))) + geom_col(fill = "royalblue2") +
  labs(title = "2020 Bigrams", y = "Bigrams")

nightvale_2021 <- annual_bigrams %>%
  filter(Year == "2021")

graph2021 <- nightvale_2021 %>%
  head(5)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= n, y = reorder(bigrams,n))) + geom_col(fill = "plum") +
  labs(title = "2021 Bigrams", y = "Bigrams")

nightvale_2022 <- annual_bigrams %>%
  filter(Year == "2022")

graph2022 <- nightvale_2022 %>%
  head(5)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= n, y = reorder(bigrams,n))) + geom_col(fill = "yellow2") +
  labs(title = "2022 Bigrams", y = "Bigrams")
```
```{r bigramPlots, message=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=11}
bigrams_by_year <- plot_grid(graph2012, graph2013, graph2014, graph2015, graph2016, graph2017,
             graph2018, graph2019, graph2020, graph2021, graph2022, 
             nrow = 6, ncol = 2)

plot_grid(all_bg, bigrams_by_year, nrow = 2, rel_heights = c(1/4, 3/4))
```

  From this we can see that "Night vale" is the most common bigram every year, 
but that "dog park" only breaks into the top 5 in 2012, 2013, and 2015. We can
also see the rise and fall of terms such as "Desert Bluffs", the adjacent town
to Nightvale which is owned and operated by "StrexCorp Synernists Incorporated". 
It makes the top 5 in 2013, 2015, and 2016, but never after that. This is 
because in episode 83, aired in 2016, Desert Bluffs was forcibly annexed into
Nightvale. 

```{r tf_idf, message=FALSE}
nightvale_tf <- nightvale %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, Transcript) %>%
  mutate(word = gsub("â€™", "", word)) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  add_count(Year, name = "Total_Words") %>%
  group_by(Year, Total_Words) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

nightvale_tf <- subset(nightvale_tf, !grepl("[^a-zA-Z]", word))
  

nightvale_tf_idf <- nightvale_tf %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, Year, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))

yearly_tf <- nightvale_tf_idf %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  facet_bar(y = word, x = tf_idf, by = Year, nrow = 6)

all_tf <- nightvale_tf_idf %>%
  slice_max(11, with_ties = FALSE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tf_idf, y = reorder(word, tf_idf))) + geom_col() +
  labs(title = "'Welcome to Nightvale' TF-IDF",x = "", y = "Word")
```

```{r word tf-idf,fig.width=6.5, fig.height=11, message=FALSE}
plot_grid(all_tf, yearly_tf, nrow = 2, rel_heights = c(1/6, 5/6))
```

  
  While simple counts are helpful, the term frequency-inverse document
frequency is a better measure of how important a word is to a document or
collection. This lets us see that in 2012, "Amelia" was the most relevant word
overall in the entire collection, but that she was only the most relevant in 
2020 when looking at each year.

```{r bigrams1, fig.width=6.5}
nightvale_bigrams_tf <- nightvale %>%
  unnest_tokens(bigrams, Transcript, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>%
  separate(bigrams, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word,
         !word2 %in% stop_words$word,
         is.na(word1) == FALSE,
         is.na(word2) == FALSE,
         !grepl("[^a-zA-Z]", word1),
         !grepl("[^a-zA-Z]", word1)) %>%
  unite(bigrams, word1, word2, sep = " ") %>%
  add_count(Year, name = "Total_Words") %>%
  group_by(Year, Total_Words) %>%
  count(bigrams, sort = TRUE)

nightvale_bigrams_tf<- nightvale_bigrams_tf %>%
  bind_tf_idf(bigrams, Year, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))

all_bgs_tf <- nightvale_bigrams_tf %>%
  slice_max(tf_idf, n= 2, with_ties = FALSE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tf_idf, y = reorder(bigrams, tf_idf))) + geom_col() +
  labs(title = "'Welcome to Nightvale' Bigram TF-IDF", x = "", 
       y = "Bigrams")

yearly_bgs_tf <- nightvale_bigrams_tf %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  slice_max(tf_idf, n= 10, with_ties = FALSE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  facet_bar(y = bigrams, x = tf_idf, by = Year, nrow = 6)
```


```{r bigram tf_idf, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=12, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot_grid(all_bgs_tf, yearly_bgs_tf, nrow = 2, rel_heights = c(1/4, 3/4))
```

  We can get a more detailed view by looking at bigrams, and by grouping our 
data by year. This let's us see how various characters are.

### Sentiments

```{r, fig.width= 6.5, fig.height=12, message=FALSE}
tidy_vale_sentiments <- tidy_vale %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(index = Episode, sentiment) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

all_s <- tidy_vale_sentiments %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = index, y = sentiment)) + 
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Bing et al. Sentiment Scores for Welcome to Nightvale Podcast",
       x = "Cumulative Episode #", y = "Sentiment Score")


annual_sentiments <- tidy_vale %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(index = Relative_Episode, sentiment) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

year_s <- annual_sentiments %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = index, y = sentiment, fill = factor(Year), group = Year)) + 
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +
  labs(x = "Episode #", y = "Sentiment Score") +
  facet_wrap(~Year, nrow = 6)

plot_grid(all_s, year_s, nrow = 2,  rel_heights = c(1/4, 3/4))
  
```
  
  We can see here that the overall sentiment of the show is negative. It makes
sense when looking at the overall themes and genres of the show though. The 
podcast is classified as horror fiction, meaning overall darker tones. It also
edges into the genre of cosmic horror, which functions as a subgenere of horror
fiction that empahsizes the horror of the incomprehensible and unknowable
instead of gore or shock. Works in this genre tend to emphasize themes of cosmic
dread, forbidden/dangerous knowledge, madness, and non human-influences on 
religion, superstition, humanity,  and fate. All of these are topics that we 
affix a negative sentiment to, so it seems obvious that a radio show that uses
all of these themes would contain words with a larger negative sentiment.
